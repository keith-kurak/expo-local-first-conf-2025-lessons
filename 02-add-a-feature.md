# Module 02: Thin Vertical Slice - add schema and UI to create a new feature

### Goal

Let's hone in on a thin vertical slice of functionality across Livestore schema and React Native UI development to get a small taste of what it's like working on such a project.

### Concepts

- Livestore schema changes
- React Native frontend development
- React Native Reanimated (native animations)

### Tasks

- Add the schema to designate a reaction as a "super" reaction
- Add a migration for the schema
- Add the long-press-for-super-reaction functionality
- Give this functionality a fancy animation using Reanimated

# Exercises

## Exercise 1: Super-react schema

The app already has "reactions", where you can give a note a thumbs up or a heart. Let's add "super reaction" functionality, where holding down the reaction will make it "super." We'll eventually add a fancy animation for this, but for now, let's focus on the data layer.

We're going to add a single field to the `reaction` table, a `type` that is either `regular` (the default) or `super`. Long-pressing on the initial reaction will make it super. Long-pressing on an existing reaction you've already made will update that reaction to be super.

When we think about databases and changing schema, we often think about schema migrations and migrations. In the case of Livestore, we only make schema changes that are forward-compatible. We can add fields as long as they're optional or have a default value. That way, pre-super-reaction events can be processed by a post-super-reaction client version (they're just default to "regular").

1. Inside **shared/schema.ts**, in the `reaction` table, under `columns`, add the `type` field:

```diff
deletedAt: State.SQLite.integer({
  nullable: true,
  schema: Schema.DateFromNumber,
}),
+ type: State.SQLite.text({schema: Schema.Literal("regular", "super"), default: "regular",}),
```

2. In the same file, look at the `materializers`. These are the mutations- the events that make up the change history in Livestore. We need to add a new materializer that will create a note with a `type`.

Notice that the materializers so far have a `v1` in front. Once a materializer is present, it cannot be deleted, or else it would not be possible to process paste events. So, it can be helpful to create a new `v2` materializer that incorporates the `type` field. Add the following to the `materializers` list:

```ts
"v2.NoteReacted": ({ id, noteId, emoji, type, createdBy }) =>
  reaction.insert({
    id,
    noteId,
    emoji,
    type: type as "regular" | "super",
    createdBy,
    createdAt: new Date(),
  }),
```

3. You'll probably notice some TypeScript squiggles at this point. This is because we can't just define the materializer without a corresponding event. Head over to **events.ts**. Add a new event for the v2 reaction:

```ts
export const noteReacted = Events.synced({
  name: "v2.NoteReacted",
  schema: Schema.Struct({
    id: Schema.String,
    noteId: Schema.String,
    emoji: Schema.String,
    type: Schema.Literal("regular", "super"),
    createdBy: Schema.String,
  }),
});
```

You'll see more squiggles now, because there's already an event named `noteReacted` being exported. This export is useful for when we actually implement the operation in the UI. Let's rename the old `noteReacted` to `noteReacted_v1`. This means that the old event still exists for the sake of data created before the super like implementation, but the event that's actually used in the UI going forward will always be the new one.

```diff
- export const noteReacted = Events.synced({
+ export const noteReacted_v1 = Events.synced({
```

Let's update the bottom sheet that pops up when you'd like to add a reaction to accept the new type parameter. This also serves as a bit of an example of how file-based routing works in an Expo app. The bottom sheet is in **packages/mobile/app/(home)/reaction/[note].tsx**. If you look inside the **packages/mobile/app/(home)/\_layout.tsx** file, you'll see the `reaction/[note]` route referenced with `presentation: "formSheet"`. This means that the bottom sheet is a separate screen that pushes on top of the list of notes, but is partially transparent, so you can still see the list underneath it. The `[note]` part of the route is where the note ID is passed, so the screen knows which note the reaction is for.

4. In **app/(home)/reaction/[note].tsx**, update `handleReaction` to incorporate the type:

```diff
- function handleReaction(emoji: string) {
+ function handleReaction(emoji: string, type: "regular" | "super" = "regular") {
  store.commit(
    events.noteReacted({
      id: nanoid(),
      noteId: noteId,
      emoji: emoji,
+      type: type,
      createdBy: user!.name,
    })
  );
  router.back();
}
```

> If you hover over the `noteCreated` function, you'll see in intellisense how it is mapping back to `v1.noteCreated`, but it omits the v1.

Then update the `onPress` and add the `onLongPress` events:

```diff
<Pressable
  key={reaction}
+  onLongPress={() => handleReaction(reaction, "super")}
>
  <ReactionItem key={reaction} reaction={reaction} />
</Pressable>
```

🏃**Try it.** You should be able to regular react and super react now. Though you can't see the effects of a super-react yet. You can inspect the event in devtools in order to know that the super reaction was included as part of the note creation event.

## Exercise 2: Showing the super reaction

There's probably a lot of different ways we could show super-reactions, but let's start by showing them as a separate badge number with an orange background.

There's already a query for reactions. It returns the number of reactions on a note by emoji. In LiveStore, you can use the query syntax for many standard queries, but in this case, we wanted an aggregate query, so we used plain SQLite syntax instead. Let's modify that query to return reactions and super-reaction counts separately.

1. In **packages/shared/queries.ts**, update the query for super reaction counts:

```ts
export const noteReactionCountsByEmoji$ = (noteId: string) =>
  queryDb(
    {
      query: sql`
          SELECT
            emoji,
-            COUNT(*) AS count,
+            SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'regular' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS regularCount,
+            SUM(CASE WHEN type = 'super' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS superCount
          FROM reaction
          WHERE noteId = ? AND deletedAt IS NULL
          GROUP BY emoji
        `,
      schema: Schema.Array(
        Schema.Struct({
          emoji: Schema.String,
-          count: Schema.Number,
+          regularCount: Schema.Number,
+          superCount: Schema.Number,
        })
      ),
      bindValues: [noteId],
    },
    { label: `reaction-counts-${noteId}`, deps: [noteId] }
  );
```

2. In **packages/mobile/components/NoteReaction.tsx**, update the loop to handle regular reactions correctly:

```diff
- {reactionCounts.map(({ emoji, count }) => (
+ {reactionCounts.map(({ emoji, regularCount, superCount }) => (
    <View
      key={emoji}
      style={noteReactionsStyles.reactionButton as ViewStyle}
    >
      <Text style={noteReactionsStyles.emojiText as TextStyle}>
        {emoji}
      </Text>
      {regularCount > 0 && (
        <Text
          style={[
            noteReactionsStyles.countText as TextStyle,
            { right: -10, top: -5 },
          ]}
        >
-          {count}
+          {regularCount}
        </Text>
      )}
```

3. Directly under the regular reaction badge, add a super reaction badge, which will appear in the _bottom_ right corner of the emoji

```tsx
{superCount > 0 && (
    <Text
    style={[
      noteReactionsStyles.countText as TextStyle,
      { right: -10, bottom: -5, backgroundColor: "orange" },
    ]}
  >
    {superCount}
  </Text>
)}
```

🏃**Try it.** You should now see regular reaction and super reaction counts separately. 

## Exercise 3: Fancy animations! Haptics!

Super reactions aren't really all that super until they have some pizzaz. We're going to add a cool particle effect using React Native Reanimated. This will occur while the long press is in progress, like you're charging up until the reaction is "super".

Open **/packages/mobile/components/ReactionParticles.tsx**, take a look at this component. It creates a particle explosion effect using React Native Reanimated. The component generates 8 small animated particles that burst outward from a central point in a circular pattern. Each particle has randomized properties (size, delay, distance) and uses shared values with animated styles to control its opacity, scale, and position. The particles appear, move outward, and then fade away, creating a satisfying visual feedback effect when a reaction is on its way to becoming "super". We'll use this to add visual flair when pressing a reaction.

In the reaction bottom sheet (**/packages/mobile/app/(home)/reaction/[note].tsx**),

1. First, let's add a state variable to keep track of when to show or hide the particles:

```tsx
const [emojiPressInProgress, setEmojiPressInProgress] = useState<
    string | undefined
  >(undefined);
```

When an animation should be in progress, this state variable will contain the emoji that should show the animation.

2. The animation uses absolute positioning to layer over any siblings in the view hierarchy, so we can just mount it when `emojiPressInProgress` is truthy: 

```diff
 <ReactionItem key={reaction} reaction={reaction} />
+  {emojiPressInProgress === reaction ? (<ReactionParticles color="orange" />) : null}
</Pressable>
```

We could get really fancy with long press timing by using a `Gesture.Tap` component from `react-native-reanimated`, precisely controlling the duration of the long press, when the animation starts and stops, etc. But we will keep it simple for now, mounting the animation component when a press starts and unmounting it when the press completes. This will be too fast for a short press, but just perfect for a long press.

3. Use `onPressIn` and `onPressOut` to set `emojiPressInProgress` for the duration of the press:

```diff
<Pressable
  key={reaction}
  onPress={() => handleReaction(reaction)}
  onLongPress={() => handleReaction(reaction, "super")}
+  onPressIn={() => setEmojiPressInProgress(reaction)}
+  onPressOut={() => setEmojiPressInProgress(undefined)}
>
```

🏃**Try it.** Now when you long-press on a reaction, you should see a particle explosion effect while it's being charged up to become a super reaction! Feel free to play with the `ReactionParticles` props until you achieve something that feels good.

4. Finally, let's use `expo-haptics` to add a little tactile buzz to adding a reaction. Inside `handleReaction`, add a short buzz for a regular react and a heavy buzz for a super react:

```tsx
Haptics.impactAsync(type === "regular" ? Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Light : Haptics.ImpactFeedbackStyle.Heavy);
```

## Bonus
- We could use a lot of the same logic in the bottom sheet inside of **NoteReaction.tsx** to also allow long pressing of an emoji already appearing below the note to also add a super reaction. Try doing this.
